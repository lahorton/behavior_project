<h2>Behavior Intervention Basics</h2>
<ul id="basics">
    <li> 1) Choose one targeted behavior and thoughtfully select one intervention to address it. 
    </li><br>
    <li> 2) Collect baseline data.  Collect 3-5 data-points before starting the intervention to determine the studentâ€™s baseline, or starting point, in the behavior that is being targeted for intervention. This baseline will be useful to compare to the the outcome and measure progress after implementing the intervention. 
    </li><br>
    <li> 3) Determine the length of the intervention.  Good practice suggests 6-8 weeks to evaluate meaningful progress.
    </li><br>
    <li> 4) Based on the baseline and the length of the intervention, determine the intervention goal.  
    </li><br>
    <li> 5) Once you've tried the intervention for the determined timeframe, evaluate progress.  This is a good opportunity to reflect on how appropriate the intervention was for the targetted behavior, strategize next steps, and celebrate student success!  
    </li><br>
